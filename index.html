<h2>About Me</h2>

<p class="first">Hello, my name is Lauren! I'm a non-traditional student attending
<a href="https://www.weber.edu/">Weber State University</a> majoring in
Computer Science. I originally attended
<a href="https://www.southeastern.edu/">Southeastern Louisiana
University</a> for a degree in Biological Sciences with a concentration in
Environmental Science and Conservation Biology. Unfortunately, I didn't
complete that degree due to circumstances out of my control, but I am exited to
be back in school and I am grateful that in the interim I realized how useful a
computer science degree is.</p>

<p class="second">During the time my husband Art was working on his doctoral
degree we took in a few stray cats; Cheeto found us first, then Arthur, then
Bobby. My cats are my entire world. I've always been an animal person, but
growing up my family only had dogs. After we took Cheeto in I realized I am a
cat person through and through. Unfortunately, in March 2024 we lost Bobby
unexpectedly, but we'll remember him always.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy playing video games with my husband and friends, or
reading if I am not feeling social. SciFi is my favorite genre. I
also enjoy fiber arts and I knit, crochet, and embroider as a creative
outlet. My husband and I love attending music festivals, and we meet up with
his family every year at Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival.</p>
